## Overview 
## Operner.io
The Opener application is a Law Enforcement rating system that allows users in any state or location to identify police officers and stations registered within a province. It allows users to record their feedback or rating to either subject based on personal encounters, observations, or reports of cases of crime or an emergency.


It is a follow-up project based on the methodology in the academic thesis research. The system consists of three interfaces for different usersâ€”a new Flutter project to completed in Dart Programming Language. 

Thus, this link is only for populating new progress on the application and for future reference. Also, due to the requirements needed for usability, I intend to work towards completing the application and meeting those objectives (i.e. Approval and a list of participants from the Permanent Secretary Interior of Nigeria) as a second project after the research and upon completion of my master programme.
