# Opener.io

## Overview 
Opener may be defined as a secure reporting system that connects citizens to officers and police stations within their vicinity. It allows users to provide reviews and ratings on officers or police stations to improve transparency in the Police Force. It guarantees the privacy of users' personally identifiable information shared when filing a report and writing reviews through encryption mechanisms and data anonymisation.

Ratings will be based on citizen encounter with a police officer or a police station by providing users with a search option to find police stations registered within their city. View noted police officers allocated to each station, allow users to compare and deliver ratings, do reviews (anonymously or publicly) and report crimes or an emergency (e.g., a fire outbreak) via control numbers registered on the application.

It is a follow-up project based on the methodology in my academic thesis research. The system consists of three user interfaces for different users â€” a new Flutter project to completed in Dart Programming Language.
